# JavaScript Assessment - practice
**Windows Users**: Please use one of our workstation machines for the assessments.

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas,
jQuery, AJAX, or Underscore templates.

You have 80 minutes. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your code
should go in the `src/` directory in the files provided. All your
functions should be namespaced under `Assessment`.

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.
